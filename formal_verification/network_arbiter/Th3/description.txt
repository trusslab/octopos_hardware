When arbiter is in trusted state, all values of I/O data interface signals are identical to FIFO interface values

This proof is very simple. to show that the aribter is in trusted state, we use an assume function.
   assume(trusted == 1'b1);

Then we used several assert functions to show that MUX output is connected to trusted signals (coming from the FIFO).
