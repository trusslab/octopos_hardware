In this proof we show that if there is no write from control interface (network doamin in current implementation) state of the arbitter cannot change.

To do so we keep the previous state of the arbitter (state of the arbitter in the previous clock cycle) in a register.
To check that no write happens we use assume(s_ctrl0_axi_wvalid == 1'b0);

and finally we show that the state remained unchanged using an assert function:
 assert (prev_trusted == trusted);
