Nothing other than a timer tik  changes the data quota 

assume(timer_req == 0); : timer tik does not happen

assume( !((owner_id == `ID0)&&( {limit,timer}!={`INFINITY,`INFINITY}))  );   :
a normal domain with non infinit qouta is owning the mailbox


 (!reset_latched) && (owner_id == prev_owner_id) ):
(!reset_latched): we did not reset the mailbox in prevous clock cycle, and
(owner_id == prev_owner_id): a deligation did not take place


 assert(timer == prev_timer); time qouta remained unchanged.
