Nothing other than a data read changes the data quota 

assume(limit_req == 0); : data read does not happen

assume( !((owner_id == `ID0)&&( {limit,timer}!={`INFINITY,`INFINITY}))  );   :
a normal domain with non infinit qouta is owning the mailbox

(!reset_latched): we did not reset the mailbox in prevous clock cycle, and
(owner_id == prev_owner_id): a deligation did not take place


assert(owner_id == prev_owner_id):  data qouta remained unchanged.
