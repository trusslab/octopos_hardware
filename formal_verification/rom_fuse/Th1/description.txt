This proof is very straightforward. As the ROM fuse device is designed in a specific way that is not dependent on the reset signal, even the reset signal can be inputted by the proof solver (can take arbitrary values).
The proof goes as follows:
On positive edges of the clock, we increment a counter which is initialized to 'Zero'. When the counter is 'One' one CLK cycle after the beginning of the test we assume that the ROM fuse has been locked. 
Then we ask the prover to prove that the ROM fuse cannot be unlocked in the following clock cycles no matter how other signals are changing.
