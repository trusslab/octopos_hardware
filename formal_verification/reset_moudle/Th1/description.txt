This proof is very straightforward.
We assume that the fr (first reset) signal is not on. it means that it is not the first time that we want to reset a domain (because for that one we treat it specially and let it go through). Assuming fr =0 , 
we check if any of the mailbox busy signals are 1 (mailboxes_busy != 4'b0)   we should not let the output zero become active. 
assert(out_reset_n == 1'b1);
Please note that the output reset signal is active low.
