OctopOS Hardware

This documents walk through the steps to populate our hardware design, and launch OctopOS software on top of it.

1) cd to the folder where the tcl file is located,

2) To re-create the hardware project, install Vivado 2019.1 (other versions might not work), source Vivado's settings.sh, run `vivado -source XXX.tcl`,

3) Re-create the mailbox projects in the same way, package them, and add their paths to the IP repo of the main project.

4) Generate bitstream,

5) Export the hardware design to SDK,

6) Open SDK, 
Zephyr notes: there might be better ways to organzie SDK files. These SDK files are mostly generated by configuring each subproject for each core. The linker script, subproject BSP settings, compiler flags, are the things that matters. We have no modification to the generated BSP drivers, and this repo contains no OctopOS code. They need to be mounted later.

7) edit scripts/cp_drivers.sh with correct paths, and run it.

8) edit scripts/mount-octopos-sdk.sh with correct paths to OctopOS source, and run it.
Zephyr notes: for now, please checkout 5146bed30e57ad378d83cc640e4daf4d53a34f1d commit on `sec_hw_untrusted_dev` branch.
